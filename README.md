Subjectively Objective is a game where you assume the role of an influencer who receives headlines generated by an AI and must decide what to publish without knowing if they are real or fake.  

Your editorial judgment will shape the world, feed conspiracy theories or defend truths at the cost of better numbers. All under pressure of time, audience and social consequences.
